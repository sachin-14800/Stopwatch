# Stopwatch

A web based stopwatch build using javascript having functionality of start,stop,reset and flag the time.

We are using the setTimeout function which keeps on calling the cyclestart function again and again after 10 miliseconds and thus increasing the count of miliseconds and thus seconds then minutes and then hours.

The start button will start the stopwatch.

The stop button will pause the stopwatch.

The reset button will make watch back to its original state i.e. 0hr 0 min 0 sec.

The flag button will keep on adding the flag time a the flagged container.
